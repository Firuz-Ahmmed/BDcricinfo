            <h1>History of cricket in Bangladesh</h1>
            <p>Bangladesh In 1947 India divided into two parts, one remains India and another named Pakistan. Pakistan had two parts, one was the West Pakistan & another was East Pakistan. Dhaka was the capital of the East Pakistan. Pakistan government and military ware largely dominated by the upper classes from the West. The Bengali Language movement of 1952 was the first sign of friction between two wings of Pakistan. Dissatisfaction with the central government over economic & cultural issues continued to rise through the next decade. In 1971, under the great leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and unconditional secrifice of thousands of Bengali Freedom Fighters (in Bangla – Mukti Joddha) a bloody liberation war took place for nine months and more then 30,000 people sacrifice their life. On 16 December in 1971, Pakistan surrendered and Bangladesh become an independent country. Many people of Cricket fetarnity also took place on the liberation war of 1971 and sacrificed their life, Shaheed Mushtaq and Shaheed Jewel are among them.</p>

            <p>1972: The Bangladesh Cricket Control Board (BCCB) is established. Soon after, a cricket league commences in Dhaka and Chittagong. It is a slow start, other things having priority in the war-torn country.
                <br>Early in 1975 the Dhaka (then &#8220;Dacca&#8221;) stadium was still in disrepair, the square having sunk several inches and the Press Club shell-torn.</p>
